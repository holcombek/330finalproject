    <p>Bryce Canyon is a great option to visit if you have a day to spare while out west.
      A short, scenic drive from Zion National Park, there are many short hikes available for
      people across experience levels. In addition, the park is easy to navigate by vehicle, allowing
      visitors to access the highest viewpoints by personal vehicle or park shuttle.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Although the park can be quite crowded on its most popular trails, such as Queen's Garden/Navajo
      Combination Loop, there is always sufficient space to enjoy the views while hiking, as well as
      plenty of photo spots. We found there was a few school groups visiting that day which was unexpected,
      but did not cause any issues on the trail. That particular hike was the main hike my mom and I completed while in
      the park and it took about 2 1/2 hours and was relatively easy.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Many of the photos below are from this trail and it offers a wide range of landscapes as you hike down into the
      canyon.
      One of the coolest parts was right at the end, at a part called Wall Street. It's a short, steep, and curvy trip,
      but gives
      a stunning view from the bottom as you travel upwards.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Of course there are many other trails to take on and even can be done on horseback. In addition, there are many
      viewpoints
      accessible that give a wide view of the entire canyon. The perspective of the canyon as it expands outward is one
      you can't
      miss, and you can see it from a variety of altitudes.
