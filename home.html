    <p>Have you ever wanted to go out west and visit Utah's national parks? I was in that same spot last year as I was
      planning my summer, and ended up choosing these two parks to visit over a week long trip. Had I had more time,
      I definitely would have added more onto to my trip. With that, here's a complete (amateur's) guide to
      two of Utah's most visited national parks - <a href='https://www.nps.gov/brca/index.htm' target="_blank">Bryce
        Canyon</a> and <a href='https://www.nps.gov/zion/index.htm' target="_blank">Zion</a>.
      Included are recommend hikes, photo spots, and general tips coming from an amateur hiker.
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>These two parks have a long history in the national parks system, with Zion being established in 1919 by the
      National Park Service and Bryce Canyon in 1928. With nearly 5 million visitors in 2021, Zion is one of the most
      popular national parks.
      Bryce Canyon is less popular, with only about 2.1 million visitors in 2021, but offers its own unique views and
      activities. The number of visitors per year has surely increased, especially in recent years, so carefully
      planning out your trip is important to
      ensure you can see everything on your list without being in a crowd the entire time. </p>

      <p>My mom and I went the first week of May and found that while there was some crowds of school trips or family
        trips, we were able to hit every hike on our list without any major crowds. In addition, the weather was perfect
        (coming from a Michigan resident)
        especially as Utah can reach nearly 100 degrees farenheit during the months of July and August. So, depending on
        your temperature sensitivity, planning around the weather is the recommended way to go.  As you can see above, I dressed
        comfortably for the weather and any potential changes in temperature.

      <p>There are many national parks in the west and multiple just in Utah, so wherever you decide to go, I wish you
        happy hiking and great weather!</p>

        to a few of my other favorite national parks.</p>
