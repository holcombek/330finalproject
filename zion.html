    <p>Zion National Park is a great park to visit -- it offers day hikes, backpacking, rafting, and more. To get the
      full experience, I recommend at least 2-3 days to hit all the hikes and views you'd like to see. Unlike Bryce
      Canyon, Zion offers two areas of the park - the Zion Canyon
      and the Kolob Canyon Area. Zion Canyon, while holding the most popular views and hikes, is much more crowded.
      The Kolob Canyon area offers a more quiet feel of the park -- different views and a different landscape as well.
      Between these two parks, there is plenty to fill
      your days with. </p> <br>
    <p>In the main park, there is a shuttle service that takes you through the main part of the park and gives easy
      access to every hike in the park. Although it can be crowded at times, it removes the struggle of finding parking
      and is much more environmentally friendly. They even offer the service
      throughout the town just outside the park, for those that chose to stay in a hotel on the main road. In addition,
      there is an area just inside the park that allows for RV camping right by a main trailhead.
